// const 12HourClockTime = "20:53";
// const 24hourClockTime = "08:53";

// The error occurs because the variable name '12HourClockTime' starts with a digit, which is not allowed in JavaScript.
// Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
// To fix this error, we can rename the variable to start with a letter or an underscore.
// For example, we can rename it to 'hour12ClockTime' or '_12HourClockTime'.
const hour12ClockTime = "20:53";
const hour24ClockTime = "08:53";

console.log(`The 12-hour clock time is: ${hour12ClockTime}`);
console.log(`The 24-hour clock time is: ${hour24ClockTime}`);
// This will correctly output the 12-hour and 24-hour clock times without any errors.
